  "description": "Picking up what appeared to be a runaway girl, next to the cigarette vending machine at a convenience store, Hira Katsuki, the protagonist, reluctantly takes her home to protect her, thinking it would be troublesome to leave her with a handmade cardboard tag around her neck that says | Please pick me up | and that she would be involved in a crime if left unattended. When he asks her why she ran away from home, she continues to joke around about it. The two gradually come to know each other through their conflicting conversations, and promise to live together for one week only.",
